        <p>学习的方法应该要常反思，并且多加以记忆。</p>
<p>今天认为学习的最好的方法，在自学的过程中，应该追求一个各一个的短期目标，并尽快实现，这样在进行的过程中，天然的就容易具有成就感。</p>
<p>在做错题的过程中要常常寻找错的原因，不能够单纯的放过错误，错误与失败是最好的老师。</p>
<p>学会办事，就是把自己应该做到的事做好，别人没做到的应当责怪的就加以责怪。而不是做老好人<img src="C:\Users\weare\Desktop\微信图片_20190303153033.jpg" alt="微信图片_20190303153033">。</p>

<p>无人机还被用于越境走私违禁品以及劫狱。</p>
<p>近期，也门的胡赛叛乱分子利用无人机袭击了一个军事阅兵场的高级指挥中心，据报道导致了6名士兵的死亡。</p>
<p>原文：<br>Rules for flying robots<br>飞行机器人之规则</p>
<p>Drones need to be encouraged, and people protected<br>无人机应该受到鼓励，但人们也需要得到保护</p>
<p>Tighter regulations will not hamper troublemakers<br>再严格的监管也不会阻止麻烦制造者</p>
<p>While testing a drone to detect sharks off a beach in New South Wales last year, Australian lifeguards spotted two young men struggling to swim in the violent surf.<br>去年，澳大利亚的救生员在新南威尔士州的一个海滩上测试用于探测鲨鱼的无人机时，发现两名年轻男子在波涛汹涌的海浪中奋力地游着。</p>
<p>The drone was dispatched to drop an inflatable pod, which the men used to reach the shore safely.<br>他们便操纵着无人机将一个充气筏投了下去，这两个人利用这个充气筏安全地抵达了岸边。</p>
<p>Such civilian drones are saviours that have helped rescue mountain-climbers and people trapped by natural disasters.<br>这种民用无人机是一些人的救星，它可以用来帮助那些等待救援的登山者以及遭受自然灾害的受困者。</p>
<p>They carry emergency medical supplies and organs for transplant.<br>它们还可以用来运输紧急医疗用品以及用于移植的人体器官。</p>
<p>Apart from saving souls, civilian drones are becoming a good business.<br>除了救人外，民用无人机正在成为一门好生意。<br>Goldman Sachs, a bank, reckons that the market will be worth $100bn by 2020 in areas such as surveying, security and delivery.<br>据高盛银行估计，到2020年，民用无人机在勘测、安全和运输等领域的市场价值将达到1000亿美元。</p>
